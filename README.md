Currently, our smart contract is being tested, and executed in the "Solidity" programming language.  Very soon we can deploy our project in the "LuksoL16" testnet.

The project plans to implement an innovation in the field of "staking with NFT help".  Making it easier for users to access staking with the power of Web3 technologies.  To participate in LYXe staking, it is enough to keep this NFT, immobilized, on your wallet. Our project consists of three team members, an Artist, a Graphic Designer, and 1 Developer.

Due to growing environmental concerns and CO2 emissions from manufacturing, POW networks, we have chosen a theme for our NFTs with images of 100 individual trees to draw attention to the environmental and ecological impact.

The Trees NFT is planned to be implemented as decentralized as possible.  

ECONOMIC Model "THE TREES NFT":

From an economic point of view, NFTs are planned to be backed by a special Lukso blockchain node, the profits from which will be distributed to holders for as long as the blockchain exists.
