Currently, our smart contract is being tested, and executed in the "Solidity" programming language.  Very soon we can deploy our project in the "LuksoL16" testnet.

The project plans to implement an innovation in the field of "staking with NFT help".  Making it easier for users to access staking with the power of Web3 technologies.  To participate in LYXe staking, it is enough to keep this NFT, immobilized, on your wallet.  a collection of 100 individual non-fungible tokens implies the most decentralized NFT.  Our project consists of three team members, an Artist, a Graphic Designer, and 1 Developer.

Due to the growing environmental problems and CO2 emissions, POW class networks, we decided to implement this project on the Lukso eco-friendly blockchain.  And we chose a theme for our NFTs with images of rare and endangered tree species.
